  <h1>Support Blog</h1>
  <p> Every day, there are millions who suffer due to scarcity and housing crises.  Oftentimes, the homeless are neglected by society and are not given the support and resources that they need to survive.  That's why we need to show them some support.  That's why they need YOUR help.  Here are ten ways that YOU can support those in need in your local community (made with the aid of ChatGPT):</p>

    <p>Shelters depend on your donations to ensure their quality is up to standard.</p></li>
    <li><h3>Raising Awareness</h3>
